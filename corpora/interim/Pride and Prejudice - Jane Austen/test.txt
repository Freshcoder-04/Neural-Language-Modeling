"

"Their conduct has been such," replied Elizabeth, "as neither you, nor
I, nor any body, can ever forget. --Elizabeth instantly read her feelings, and at that moment
solicitude for Wickham, resentment against his enemies, and every thing
else gave way before the hope of Jane's being in the fairest way for
happiness. Collins! my dear Charlotte,--impossible!"

The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her
story, gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a
reproach; though, as it was no more than she expected, she soon
regained her composure, and calmly replied,

"Why should you be surprised, my dear Eliza?--Do you think it incredible
that Mr. I quite detest the man. "You have no regard, then, for the honour and credit of my nephew!
Unfeeling, selfish girl! Do you not consider that a connection with you,
must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody?"

"Lady Catherine, I have nothing farther to say. Her figure was elegant, and she walked well;--but Darcy, at
whom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly studious. "

"I do, I do like him," she replied, with tears in her eyes, "I love him. They have each their
advantages, and I can be equally happy in either. Though suspicion was very far
from Miss Bennet's general habits, she was absolutely incredulous here. But in such cases as these,
a good memory is unpardonable. I do not deserve it. END OF VOL. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. Gardiner's
long letter, but now, having _that_ to communicate which she knew would
be most welcome, she was almost ashamed to find, that her uncle and aunt
had already lost three days of happiness, and immediately wrote as
follows:

     "I would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as I ought to have
     done, for your long, kind, satisfactory, detail of particulars; but
     to say the truth, I was too cross to write. They could
not be untouched by his politeness, and had they drawn his character
from their own feelings, and his servant's report, without any reference
to any other account, the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known,
would not have recognised it for Mr. Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

address most truly the gentleman. "

"I will not trust myself on the subject," replied Wickham, "_I_ can
hardly be just to him. When he was gone, they were certain at least of receiving constant
information of what was going on, and their uncle promised, at parting,
to prevail on Mr. gutenberg. Bennet's leaving them together, after a
longer irritation than usual about Netherfield and its master, she could
not help saying,

"Oh! that my dear mother had more command over herself; she can have no
idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him. I longed to
know whether he would be married in his blue coat. But she is nothing to me now. 1813. There were two nephews of Lady Catherine to require them, for
Mr. Haggerston has our directions, and
     all will be completed in a week. She wished, she
feared that the master of the house might be amongst them; and whether
she wished or feared it most, she could scarcely determine. Collins must excuse
me. "

"_You_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room," said Mr. Gardiner, whose curiosity
as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive. Hurst had therefore nothing to do, but to stretch himself on one of the
sophas and go to sleep. Gardiner would be prevented by business from
setting out till a fortnight later in July, and must be in London again
within a month; and as that left too short a period for them to go so
far, and see so much as they had proposed, or at least to see it with
the leisure and comfort they had built on, they were obliged to give up
the Lakes, and substitute a more contracted tour; and, according to the
present plan, were to go no farther northward than Derbyshire. Only look at her. 9. Mr. Darcy, was in such misery
of shame, that she could hardly keep her seat. E below. is not disposed to depend upon their
     marriage; he shook his head when I expressed my hopes, and said he
     feared W. Gardiner and the children were to remain in Hertfordshire a few
days longer, as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to
her nieces. But, perhaps his sister does as well
for the present, and, as she is under his sole care, he may do what he
likes with her. Bennet, "but it is a comfort to think that, whatever of
that kind may befal you, you have an affectionate mother who will always
make the most of it. Collins would have led them round his two meadows,
but the ladies not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white
frost, turned back; and while Sir William accompanied him, Charlotte
took her sister and friend over the house, extremely well pleased,
probably, to have the opportunity of shewing it without her husband's
help. I came to try you. W. After a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with

"It is _your_ turn to say something now, Mr. March was to take
Elizabeth to Hunsford. "

"He is a sweet tempered, amiable, charming man. Morris immediately; that he is
to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be
in the house by the end of next week. Had he done his duty in that
respect, Lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle, for whatever of
honour or credit could now be purchased for her. "

"It is more than I engage for, I assure you. The
subject was pursued no farther, and the gentlemen soon afterwards went
away. But now she would no longer
conceal from her, his share in Lydia's marriage. --The envelope itself was likewise
full. He heard her attentively, and then said,

"Lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public
place or other, and we can never expect her to do it with so little
expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present
circumstances. Wickham. And it is the more to be lamented, because there is reason to
     suppose, as my dear Charlotte informs me, that this licentiousness
     of behaviour in your daughter, has proceeded from a faulty degree
     of indulgence, though, at the same time, for the consolation of
     yourself and Mrs. "

Then turning to Mr. Bingley comes, my dear," said Mrs. From the farther disadvantage of Lydia's
society she was of course carefully kept, and though Mrs. --The
possibility of his having really endured such unkindness, was enough to
interest all her tender feelings; and nothing therefore remained to be
done, but to think well of them both, to defend the conduct of each, and
throw into the account of accident or mistake, whatever could not be
otherwise explained. It does not necessarily follow that a deep,
intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours. Bennet, who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the
affair as she wished, was excessively disappointed. Now and then, they were honoured with a call from her Ladyship,
and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during
these visits. Had Lydia's marriage been
concluded on the most honourable terms, it was not to be supposed that
Mr. "This is a parade," cried he, "which does one good; it gives such an
elegance to misfortune! Another day I will do the same; I will sit in
my library, in my night cap and powdering gown, and give as much trouble
as I can,--or, perhaps, I may defer it, till Kitty runs away. --Lady Catherine was a tall, large woman, with
strongly-marked features, which might once have been handsome. "Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?" said Miss Bingley; "will
she be as tall as I am?"

"I think she will. Such I was, from eight to eight and twenty; and such I might
still have been but for you, dearest, loveliest Elizabeth! What do I not
owe you! You taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most
advantageous. "

"You must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that your
refusal of my addresses is merely words of course. At such a distance as _that_, you know, things are strangely
misrepresented. Bennet, "to walk
to Oakham Mount this morning. The hill, crowned with wood, from
which they had descended, receiving increased abruptness from the
distance, was a beautiful object. It adds even another motive. He joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their
aunt's, where his regret and vexation, and the concern of every body was
well talked over. Wickham passed all his youth there, you
know. CHAPTER XVI. Collins's conversation to herself. "I told you the other day,
of his infamous behaviour to Mr. Reynolds, either
from pride or attachment, had evidently great pleasure in talking of her
master and his sister. When the ladies were separating for the toilette, he said to Elizabeth,

"Do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel. Bingley and Jane, however, soon allowed the others to
outstrip them. I want to talk very seriously. Till I was in Kent, and saw
so much both of Mr. "

Away ran the girls, too eager to get in to have time for speech. "

She would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to her
husband, called out as she entered the library,

"Oh! Mr. 6. She had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of his
being partial to her, but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea; and Mrs. "

"We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that
evening," said Elizabeth. He had never before supposed
that, could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter, it would be
done with so little inconvenience to himself, as by the present
arrangement. This was his plan of amends--of atonement--for inheriting their father's
estate; and he thought it an excellent one, full of eligibility and
suitableness, and excessively generous and disinterested on his own
part. Darcy's
shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict, gave her a
keener sense of her sister's sufferings. Gardiner. "
Charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful, and
that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time. He was always to have gone on
Saturday, and to Saturday he still meant to stay. Forster to Meryton,
from whence they were to set out early the next morning. But it
was her business to be satisfied--and certainly her temper to be happy;
and all was soon right again. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

"He likes to have his own way very well," replied Colonel Fitzwilliam. Elizabeth received her
congratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick of this folly, took
refuge in her own room, that she might think with freedom. The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every
female of the family. --Are you much acquainted with Mr. "

"Such as vanity and pride. Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my
positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand; for I
have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the
blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation. The families who had been in town for the winter came
back again, and summer finery and summer engagements arose. It was an evening of no common delight to them all; the satisfaction of
Miss Bennet's mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face, as
made her look handsomer than ever. "

"Oh! it is of no consequence. CHAPTER XII. _Your_
retrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that the contentment
arising from them, is not of philosophy, but what is much better, of
ignorance. Proud that in a cause of compassion and honour, he had been able to get
the better of himself. "Why, if he came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent," said she,
"did he come at all?"

She could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure. I shall walk to Meryton to-morrow to hear more
about it, and to ask when Mr. Oh! he is the handsomest young man that
ever was seen!"

Wickham, Lydia, were all forgotten. If I may so express it, he has a _right_
to be proud. It
gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast; for she was in
no cheerful humour. Till this moment, I never knew myself. "Oh! Mary," said she, "I wish you had gone with us, for we had such fun!
as we went along, Kitty and me drew up all the blinds, and pretended
there was nobody in the coach; and I should have gone so all the way, if
Kitty had not been sick; and when we got to the George, I do think we
behaved very handsomely, for we treated the other three with the nicest
cold luncheon in the world, and if you would have gone, we would have
treated you too. You know my sentiments. Collins has yet
expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us, but I am very
certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for
it. Bennet was really in a most pitiable state. It was a painful, but
not an improbable, conjecture. Collins wants to marry Lizzy?"

Nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne
without anger such treatment; but Sir William's good breeding carried
him through it all; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the
truth of his information, he listened to all their impertinence with the
most forbearing courtesy. I do not wish to avoid the walk. --No one who has ever seen you
together, can doubt his affection. Collins's respectability, and
Charlotte's prudent, steady character. She wanted to ascertain the
feelings of each of her visitors, she wanted to compose her own, and to
make herself agreeable to all; and in the latter object, where she
feared most to fail, she was most sure of success, for those to whom she
endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour. She had
got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight,
and was certain of a willing listener in Jane, whenever she might wish
to talk again of either. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1. "

He listened to her with perfect indifference, while she chose to
entertain herself in this manner, and as his composure convinced her
that all was safe, her wit flowed long. "I have not the pleasure of understanding you," said he, when she had
finished her speech. In
confirmation of this, she related the particulars of all the pecuniary
transactions in which they had been connected, without actually naming
her authority, but stating it to be such as might be relied on. Bennet give up the point. Lydia--the
humiliation, the misery, she was bringing on them all, soon swallowed up
every private care; and covering her face with her handkerchief,
Elizabeth was soon lost to every thing else; and, after a pause of
several minutes, was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the
voice of her companion, who, in a manner, which though it spoke
compassion, spoke likewise restraint, said, "I am afraid you have been
long desiring my absence, nor have I any thing to plead in excuse of my
stay, but real, though unavailing, concern. Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by many
people he knew, but _he_ had never seen any thing but affability in her. "

"And this," cried Darcy, as he walked with quick steps across the room,
"is your opinion of me! This is the estimation in which you hold me! I
thank you for explaining it so fully. I congratulate her. Hurst, who had
married a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider
his house as her home when it suited her. Her enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered. They were in ----

interest than the matter had ever excited before, how many years longer

Printed for T. But enough of this. But if I go on, I shall displease you by saying what
I think of persons you esteem. The vicious propensities--the
     want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge
     of his best friend, could not escape the observation of a young man
     of nearly the same age with himself, and who had opportunities of
     seeing him in unguarded moments, which Mr. Bennet could not give her consent, or
speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings,
though she talked to Bingley of nothing else, for half an hour; and when
Mr. org/files/42671/42671-h. Mrs. The respect created by the conviction of his
valuable qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some
time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings; and it was now heightened
into somewhat of a friendlier nature, by the testimony so highly in his
favour, and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light,
which yesterday had produced. CHAPTER XI. The suspicions which had just
arisen of Mr. I am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just
said, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long. --Elizabeth took leave of
the whole party in the liveliest spirits. "How abominable!--I wonder that the very
pride of this Mr. From the entrance hall, of which Mr. Elizabeth, equally
next to Jane in birth and beauty, succeeded her of course. Darcy should hear the
first raptures of her joy, than the first vehemence of her
disapprobation. To Elizabeth it appeared, that had her family made an agreement to
expose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it would
have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit, or
finer success; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister
that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice, and that his
feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he
must have witnessed. He was her dear Wickham on every
occasion; no one was to be put in competition with him. She was not sorry, however, to
have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from
whom they sprung. Unfortunately an only son, (for many years an only _child_)
I was spoilt by my parents, who though good themselves, (my father
particularly, all that was benevolent and amiable,) allowed, encouraged,
almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing, to care for none beyond
my own family circle, to think meanly of all the rest of the world, to
_wish_ at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with
my own. But when you have had time to think it all over, I hope you

casual errors, under which she would endeavour to class, what Mr. "

Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to
continue the subject. "

"And of your infliction," cried Elizabeth with energy. "

Jane shook her head. If he is satisfied with only regretting me, when he might
have obtained my affections and hand, I shall soon cease to regret him
at all. We have judged it best, that my
     niece should be married from this house, of which I hope you will
     approve. "He is indeed--but considering the inducement, my dear Miss Eliza, we
cannot wonder at his complaisance; for who would object to such a
partner?"

Elizabeth looked archly, and turned away. I cannot
     understand it. Miss Lucas is married and settled. Elizabeth, as she affectionately embraced her, whilst tears filled the
eyes of both, lost not a moment in asking whether any thing had been
heard of the fugitives. Bennet. Follies
and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies _do_ divert me, I own, and I
laugh at them whenever I can. "I hope," added Mrs. She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear
of seeing Mr. "

"May I ask to what these questions tend?"

"Merely to the illustration of _your_ character," said she, endeavouring
to shake off her gravity. --I will only say farther, that
     from what passed that evening, my opinion of all parties was
     confirmed, and every inducement heightened, which could have led me
     before, to preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy
     connection. "

"And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike
to him, without any reason. Any other inconsistencies with modern spellings have
been left as printed. "

To such perseverance in wilful self-deception Elizabeth would make no
reply, and immediately and in silence withdrew; determined, if he
persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering
encouragement, to apply to her father, whose negative might be uttered
in such a manner as must be decisive, and whose behaviour at least could
not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female. Is this to be endured! But it must not, shall not be. --"Oh! Mr. Come as soon as you can on the receipt of

"Not so much as I could wish, Sir; but I dare say he may spend half his
time here; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months. I will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first
object. Gardiner's business on her arrival, was to
distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions. "And are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real
truth! Oh, that I knew how it was!"

But wishes were vain; or at best could serve only to amuse her in the
hurry and confusion of the following hour. Bingley?"

"Not at all. Darcy has no defect. "

"In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of. But we are none
of us consistent; and in his behaviour to me, there were stronger
impulses even than pride. --The younger ones out before the elder are married!--Your
younger sisters must be very young?"

"Yes, my youngest is not sixteen. Bingley," said her husband; "it is a person whom I
never saw in the whole course of my life. To be
sure that _did_ seem as if he admired her--indeed I rather believe he
_did_--I heard something about it--but I hardly know what--something
about Mr. She wished
to discredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming, "This must be false!
This cannot be! This must be the grossest falsehood!"--and when she had
gone through the whole letter, though scarcely knowing any thing of the
last page or two, put it hastily away, protesting that she would not
regard it, that she would never look in it again. Bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter,
and impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the
opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible; advice, which there
was every reason to believe would be attended to; and in the clamorous
happiness of Lydia herself in bidding farewell, the more gentle adieus
of her sisters were uttered without being heard. "

"It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come since you will not
visit them. She was ashamed to think how
much. Denny comes back from town. "

"My motive for cautioning you, is as follows. It mortifies me. Mr. They were within twenty yards of each other, and so abrupt was his
appearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight. In this quiet way, the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away. But they are very pleasing women when you
converse with them. "

"This is the consequence you see, Madam, of marrying a daughter," said
Elizabeth. You are
not well enough;--you cannot go yourself. I wish you had been there. "

"Mr. "Oh! my dear Lydia," she cried, "when shall we meet again?"

"Oh, lord! I don't know. But at length, by Elizabeth's persuasion,
he was prevailed on to overlook the offence, and seek a reconciliation;
and, after a little farther resistance on the part of his aunt, her
resentment gave way, either to her affection for him, or her curiosity
to see how his wife conducted herself; and she condescended to wait on
them at Pemberley, in spite of that pollution which its woods had
received, not merely from the presence of such a mistress, but the
visits of her uncle and aunt from the city. His father, Miss Bennet, the late Mr. She talked on, therefore, without interruption from any of them till
they were joined by Mr. Forster, and the probability of her being yet more
imprudent with such a companion at Brighton, where the temptations must
be greater than at home. "

"You appear to me, Mr. "

Elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied, "Yes, you know enough of
my _frankness_ to believe me capable of _that_. He was most highly esteemed by Mr. "There is a gentleman with him, mamma," said Kitty; "who can it be?"

"Some acquaintance or other, my dear, I suppose; I am sure I do not
know. He added, that Mr. Mr. "Oh! dear, yes;--but you must own she is very plain. "

"Oh! no--it is not for _me_ to be driven away by Mr. 1. It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life. Darcy, and Mr. It is a nice long walk, and Mr. Mrs. Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade
in Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune and risen to the
honour of knighthood by an address to the King, during his mayoralty. "

"There is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to some particular
evil, a natural defect, which not even the best education can overcome. "Good gracious! Lord bless me! only think! dear me! Mr. Contact the

partner she had scarcely replied, before Mr. She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet's height, or
rather taller. Let me take it
in the best light, in the light in which it may be understood. Mrs. "

And when her sisters abused it as ugly, she added, with perfect
unconcern, "Oh! but there were two or three much uglier in the shop; and
when I have bought some prettier-coloured satin to trim it with fresh, I
think it will be very tolerable. His air was grave and
stately, and his manners were very formal. Darcy himself; but,
whenever she did catch a glimpse, she saw an expression of general
complaisance, and in all that he said, she heard an accent so far
removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions, as convinced her that
the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed, however
temporary its existence might prove, had at least outlived one day. At least, therefore, I did not assume the character of needless
precipitance merely to shew off before the ladies. "And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother?" said Mr. "

She burst into tears as she alluded to it, and for a few minutes could
not speak another word. Her manners were
pronounced to be very bad indeed, a mixture of pride and impertinence;
she had no conversation, no style, no taste, no beauty. No sentiment of shame gave a damp to her
triumph. 1. "

"You may depend upon my not mentioning it. This event had at last been despaired of, but it was then too
late to be saving. Lady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth's performance, mixing
with them many instructions on execution and taste. "

"I _did_ hear, too, that there was a time, when sermon-making was not so
palatable to you as it seems to be at present; that you actually
declared your resolution of never taking orders, and that the business
had been compromised accordingly. I knew you would be wishing me joy. Our poor mother
     is sadly grieved. --If, in the explanation of them which is
     due to myself, I am under the necessity of relating feelings which
     may be offensive to your's, I can only say that I am sorry. He was too happy, however, to need much attention;
and luckily for the others, the business of love-making relieved them
from a great deal of his company. I
     take up my pen again to do, what I have just told you I would not,
     but circumstances are such, that I cannot help earnestly begging
     you all to come here, as soon as possible. Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even Lydia was too
much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of "Lord,
how tired I am!" accompanied by a violent yawn. and Mrs. No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you, can
think any thing wanting. "

He then recollected her embarrassment a few days before, on his reading
Mr. Bennet could hardly comprehend
it. &c. On the contrary every particular relative
to his sister, was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself; and
if I endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct, who
will believe me? The general prejudice against Mr. --On this subject I have nothing more
     to say, no other apology to offer. Every thing, however, went on smoothly,
and was finally settled according to Charlotte's first sketch. "

He then shut the door, and coming up to her, claimed the good wishes and
affection of a sister. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this

Miss Lucas was odious to her. "

"Yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight. "

"But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow. She was overpowered by shame and
vexation. Elizabeth, who had expected to find in her as
acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Mr. --Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the
easiness, openness, ductility of his temper, though no disposition could
offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he never
appeared dissatisfied. Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother. "

Mrs. At such a moment, the arrival of her friend
was a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth, though in the course of their
meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought, when she
saw Mr. Gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing, he asked
her, if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends. The latter was much more
agreeable than his companion expected. Multiple
      superscripted characters are enclosed by curly brackets
      (example: M^{rs}). The darling wish of his
sisters was then gratified; he bought an estate in a neighbouring county
to Derbyshire, and Jane and Elizabeth, in addition to every other source
of happiness, were within thirty miles of each other. Had not my own feelings decided
against you, had they been indifferent, or had they even been
favourable, do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept
the man, who has been the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, the
happiness of a most beloved sister?"

As she pronounced these words, Mr. Bennet withdrew to the library, she saw
Mr. "

"You are over scrupulous surely. Darcy is neither by
honour nor inclination confined to his cousin, why is not he to make
another choice? And if I am that choice, why may not I accept him?"

"Because honour, decorum, prudence, nay, interest, forbid it. She
must own that she was tired of great houses; after going over so many,
she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains. " Some of them were to dine with the Philipses the
next day, and their aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr. I dare say the

extraordinary stretch of belief. "Your affectionate friend,

"I have already told her so once, by your desire. "




CHAPTER XVIII. Darcy had to decide on the propriety of
his friend's inclination, or why, upon his own judgment alone, he was to
determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy. --One does not know what to
think. Bennet, offended by his manner of mentioning a
country neighbourhood. Forgive
me; and if you persist in indifference, do not make _me_ your
confidante. "

"Are they indeed?" cried Elizabeth, with the greatest satisfaction. There is nothing else to be done. He leaves out half his words, and blots the rest. She
could not bear such suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper,
wrote a short letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of what
Lydia had dropt, if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been
intended. I have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment. --His
     sisters' uneasiness had been equally excited with my own; our
     coincidence of feeling was soon discovered; and, alike sensible
     that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother, we shortly
     resolved on joining him directly in London. Mrs. Collins's scruples of leaving Mr. --I
think it no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements. The marriage of a daughter, which had been the first object of
her wishes, since Jane was sixteen, was now on the point of
accomplishment, and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those
attendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new carriages, and
servants. Mrs. In the dining-room they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty, who had been
too busily engaged in their separate apartments, to make their
appearance before. Oh, brother,
how kind you are! I know you will contrive it all. You need not. But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness, is a most
natural consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging. I am not indebted for my present happiness to
your eager desire of expressing your gratitude. Darcy might have done as well. "

Elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those
in the room. --Elizabeth could but just _affect_ concern in
missing him; she really rejoiced at it. It would look odd to be
entirely silent for half an hour together, and yet for the advantage of
_some_, conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the
trouble of saying as little as possible. "

Elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character, but said
nothing. Wickham was as far beyond them all in person, countenance, air, and
walk, as _they_ were superior to the broad-faced stuffy uncle Philips,
breathing port wine, who followed them into the room. Bingley before, expressed to her sister how very much
she admired him. On distinguishing the ladies of the group,
the two gentlemen came directly towards them, and began the usual
civilities. intending to trace their route. "FITZWILLIAM DARCY. Their taking her home, and affording her their personal
protection and countenance, is such a sacrifice to her advantage, as
years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge. --They had several children. I was very
uncomfortable, I may say unhappy. Gardiner left them soon after breakfast. "

Mr. How much you
must have gone through!"

Her sister, however, assured her, of her being perfectly well; and their
conversation, which had been passing while Mr. Darcy appeared again, when,
looking at him, she was a little relieved by his smile. The whole family in short
were properly overjoyed on the occasion. They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to
have their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little as
possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your
life. Mrs. She is on her road somewhere, I dare say, and so passing through
Meryton, thought she might as well call on you. "

"I have not a doubt of Mr. Collins has made
you an offer of marriage. He then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to any one else. She was engaged one day as she walked, in re-perusing Jane's last
letter, and dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had not
written in spirits, when, instead of being again surprised by Mr. Collins well. Bennet's sour looks and ill-natured remarks might have been
enough to drive happiness away. You must and shall be married by a special licence. No motive can
excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted _there_. "

"Yes, vanity is a weakness indeed. "

"It is evident by this," added Jane, "that he comes back no more this
winter. Mr. Lord!
how I should like to be married before any of you; and then I would
chaperon you about to all the balls. But she had no reason to fear Mr. It cannot last long. "Now," said she, "that this first meeting is over, I feel perfectly
easy. You know not what you are
about. I am afraid you will not be able to make
     it out, but I hardly know what I have written. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. You shewed me how insufficient were all my
pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased. But who was your mother? Who
are your uncles and aunts? Do not imagine me ignorant of their
condition. Bennet's visit, and sat about ten
minutes with him in his library. "

He should be particularly happy at any time, &c. "I admire all my three sons-in-law highly," said he. They
ran through the vestibule into the breakfast room; from thence to the
library;--their father was in neither; and they were on the point of
seeking him up stairs with their mother, when they were met by the
butler, who said,

"If you are looking for my master, ma'am, he is walking towards the
little copse. It was an
encouragement of vice; and had I been the rector of Longbourn, I should
very strenuously have opposed it. Wickham, we are brother and sister, you know. "

"I know you do; and it is _that_ which makes the wonder. Miss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any
extenuating circumstances in the case, unknown to the society of
Hertfordshire; her mild and steady candour always pleaded for
allowances, and urged the possibility of mistakes--but by everybody else
Mr. Kitty, run down and order the carriage. Collins; and whatever might be his feelings towards her
friend, met her with every appearance of composure. Bennet half opened the door and called out,

"Lizzy, my dear, I want to speak with you. The
wish of procuring her regard, which she had assured herself of his
feeling in Derbyshire, could not in rational expectation survive such a
blow as this. " She then sought her eldest sister, who had undertaken to make
inquiries on the same subject of Bingley. Gardiner, though seldom able to indulge the
taste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching the
occasional appearance of some trout in the water, and talking to the man
about them, that he advanced but little. Email

would be insupportable. Bingley
was obliged to be in town the following day, and consequently unable to
accept the honour of their invitation, &c. Darcy. Not a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till their
visitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he was gone, he
turned to his daughter and said,

"Jane, I congratulate you. He
must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found
her. So near
a vicinity to her mother and Meryton relations was not desirable even to
_his_ easy temper, or _her_ affectionate heart. I believe him to be Lady Catherine's _nephew_. Neither had any thing occurred in the intelligence of
their Lambton friends, that could materially lessen its weight. Elizabeth felt Jane's
pleasure. Collins should be in possession of the
Longbourn estate, it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife
should make their appearance at St. CHAPTER III. But
my dearest love, tell me what dish Mr. "What can be the meaning of this!" said Charlotte, as soon as he was
gone. She dreaded seeing Wickham again,
and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible. They had often attempted it before, but it was a subject on which Mrs. Darcy replied with great intrepidity,

"Miss Elizabeth Bennet. They have
known her much longer than they have known me; no wonder if they love
her better. Colonel Forster came yesterday, having left Brighton the day
     before, not many hours after the express. "

They were all astonished; and Mr. Hurst and Miss Bingley, they were noticed only by a curtsey; and
on their being seated, a pause, awkward as such pauses must always be,
succeeded for a few moments. We _will_ know where
we have gone--we _will_ recollect what we have seen. He only meant that there were not
such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town, which
you must acknowledge to be true. "

"You persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him. I thought I should have died. --Mr. Mrs. In every thing else she is as
good natured a girl as ever lived. "

Miss Bennet still looked all amazement. Will you be very angry with me, my dear
     Lizzy, if I take this opportunity of saying (what I was never bold
     enough to say before) how much I like him. Mrs. "

"We are speaking of music, Madam," said he, when no longer able to avoid
a reply. Bennet could certainly
spare you for another fortnight. Mr. "

"Pride," observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her
reflections, "is a very common failing I believe. --Here you are in your own family. Wickham. It could not be for society, as he frequently sat there
ten minutes together without opening his lips; and when he did speak, it
seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice--a sacrifice to
propriety, not a pleasure to himself. Mrs. "

Elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal; yet
was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an
epithet. Her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined. He
then said,

"I have received a letter this morning that has astonished me
exceedingly. "

"To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of
either. "Well, Lizzy," continued her mother soon afterwards, "and so the
Collinses live very comfortable, do they? Well, well, I only hope it
will last. Collins too!--Why should _he_ have it more than anybody else?"

"I leave it to yourself to determine," said Mr. Bingley did
not do justice to his own disposition. They will then join his regiment,
     unless they are first invited to Longbourn; and I understand from
     Mrs. Hurst, "in running away
without telling us that you were coming out. Nothing, on the contrary, could be more natural; and while able to
suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her, she was
ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both, and could very
sincerely wish him happy. Darcy
returned within the stated time. They had frequently been staying with her in town. --Without thinking highly
either of men or of matrimony, marriage had always been her object; it
was the only honourable provision for well-educated young women of small
fortune, and however uncertain of giving happiness, must be their
pleasantest preservative from want. --The
     necessity must be obeyed--and farther apology would be absurd. It had better have happened to _you_, Lizzy; you
would have laughed yourself out of it sooner. I am not ashamed of having been
mistaken--or, at least, it is slight, it is nothing in comparison of
what I should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters. To Kitty, however, it does not
     seem so wholly unexpected. Darcy only can answer. They are not married,
     nor can I find there was any intention of being so; but if you are
     willing to perform the engagements which I have ventured to make on
     your side, I hope it will not be long before they are. He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my
acquaintance, but that is all. With amazement did
she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power;
and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to
give, which a just sense of shame would not conceal. You must
give me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the compliment of
believing what I say. But little had she dared
to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there. For a few moments, indeed,
she felt that he would probably strike into some other path. "You certainly do," she replied with a smile; "but it does not follow
that the interruption must be unwelcome. At our time of life, it is not so
pleasant I can tell you, to be making new acquaintance every day; but
for your sakes, we would do any thing. Wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled, a
doubt of his being present had never occurred to her. Had they fixed on any other man
it would have been nothing; but _his_ perfect indifference, and _your_
pointed dislike, make it so delightfully absurd! Much as I abominate
writing, I would not give up Mr. They
entered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some time through
a beautiful wood, stretching over a wide extent. Sometimes she could fancy, that he talked less than on
former occasions, and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that
as he looked at her, he was trying to trace a resemblance. They insist also on
     my seeing Mr. "When is your next ball to be, Lizzy?"

"To-morrow fortnight. "

In vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable, and Jane to make
her resigned. Girls, can I do any
thing for you in Meryton? Oh! here comes Hill. "I will go to Meryton," said she, "as soon as I am dressed, and tell the
good, good news to my sister Philips. Collins's picture of Hunsford and
Rosings rationally softened; and Elizabeth perceived that she must wait
for her own visit there, to know the rest. "

Elizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at Mr. I now give it to _you_, if you are resolved on
having him. "

"It is no such thing. She talked to Elizabeth again and again;
coaxed and threatened her by turns. Her favourite walk, and where
she frequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine, was
along the open grove which edged that side of the park, where there was
a nice sheltered path, which no one seemed to value but herself, and
where she felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherine's curiosity. The business of her life was to get her
daughters married; its solace was visiting and news. That had
his actions been what Wickham represented them, so gross a violation of
every thing right could hardly have been concealed from the world; and
that friendship between a person capable of it, and such an amiable man
as Mr. This is the last time I shall ever
remember it myself. He could even
listen to Sir William Lucas, when he complimented him on carrying away
the brightest jewel of the country, and expressed his hopes of their all
meeting frequently at St. Darcy chose to doubt it--or to treat it as a merely
conditional recommendation, and to assert that I had forfeited all claim
to it by extravagance, imprudence, in short any thing or nothing. --Not that I have much pleasure indeed in
talking to any body. "It
seems likely to have been a desirable match for Jane," said she. Her coming there was the most unfortunate, the most ill-judged
thing in the world! How strange must it appear to him! In what a
disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man! It might seem as if
she had purposely thrown herself in his way again! Oh! why did she come?
or, why did he thus come a day before he was expected? Had they been
only ten minutes sooner, they should have been beyond the reach of his
discrimination, for it was plain that he was that moment arrived, that
moment alighted from his horse or his carriage. [Illustration: A VICARAGE HOUSE. It is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit, we
cannot escape the acquaintance now. "About a month ago I received this letter, and about a fortnight ago I
answered it, for I thought it a case of some delicacy, and requiring
early attention. Collins was at leisure to look around him and admire, and he was so much
struck with the size and furniture of the apartment, that he declared he
might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour
at Rosings; a comparison that did not at first convey much
gratification; but when Mrs. Had his own happiness, however, been
the only sacrifice, he might have been allowed to sport with it in what

thought he must be sensible himself. org),

on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most
imprudent marriage, but without mentioning names or any other
particulars, and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing him
the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort, and from
knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer. "

Miss Bingley's congratulations to her brother, on his approaching
marriage, were all that was affectionate and insincere. Mr. You are all to come to Pemberley at Christmas. Her air
was not conciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them, such as to
make her visitors forget their inferior rank. Gardiner; and after relating the
circumstances, she thus went on:--"I am now convinced, my dear aunt,
that I have never been much in love; for had I really experienced that
pure and elevating passion, I should at present detest his very name,

"You must not be too severe upon yourself," replied Elizabeth. Gardiner. Collins,
and Mr. With the Gardiners, they were always on the most intimate terms. She turned from sister to sister, demanding their
congratulations, and when at length they all sat down, looked eagerly
round the room, took notice of some little alteration in it, and
observed, with a laugh, that it was a great while since she had been
there. The first mentioned

"Miss Elizabeth Bennet!" repeated Miss Bingley. This preservative she had now
obtained; and at the age of twenty-seven, without having ever been
handsome, she felt all the good luck of it. --Elizabeth accepted their company, and the three young ladies set
off together. He
found her as handsome as she had been last year; as good natured, and as
unaffected, though not quite so chatty. In revolving lady Catherine's expressions, however, she could not help
feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting
in this interference. Philips
protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery
tickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards. "There has
been many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way. She would not betray her trust, I suppose, without bribery

you meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas; but, however, I hope
it is not true. --Wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of
     my youth, the acknowledged favourite of my father, a young man who
     had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage, and who
     had been brought up to expect its exertion, would be a depravity,
     to which the separation of two young persons, whose affection could
     be the growth of only a few weeks, could bear no comparison. If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy. Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept them
mutually silent on the subject; and Elizabeth felt persuaded that no
real confidence could ever subsist between them again. "Lizzy is
only headstrong in such matters as these. Mrs. and
Mrs. Your uncle is as much surprised as I am--and nothing

that in point of true beauty, Miss De Bourgh is far superior to the
handsomest of her sex; because there is that in her features which marks
the young woman of distinguished birth. "

Elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for
her authority proceeded; but it was not in her power to give any
information of so satisfactory a nature, as the compliment deserved. Mr. If she heard me,
     it was by good luck, for I am sure she did not listen. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg

better. "

"And if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has at least
great pleasure in the power of choice. Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of
Mr. Well, he certainly is
very agreeable, and I give you leave to like him. "And they are really to be married!" cried Elizabeth, as soon as they
were by themselves. They went to the library,
therefore, and asked their father, whether he would not wish them to
make it known to her. "

"Go, my dear," cried her mother, "and shew her ladyship about the
different walks. She has been doing
every thing in her power by thinking and talking on the subject, to give
greater--what shall I call it? susceptibility to her feelings; which are
naturally lively enough. "

Elizabeth did not know what to make of it. Mr. Seriously, I would have you be on your guard. Here are officers enough at
Meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country. But
this idea was soon banished, and her spirits were very differently
affected, when, to her utter amazement, she saw Mr. Not one party, or scheme, or any thing. "

"But does Lydia know nothing of this? Can she be ignorant of what you

"Oh, yes!--that, that is the worst of all. That she should receive an offer of
marriage from Mr. --The last born has as good a right to the pleasures of

humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners!--so much ease,
with such perfect good breeding!"

"He is also handsome," replied Elizabeth, "which a young man ought
likewise to be, if he possibly can. I was not in a humour to
wait for any opening of your's. "--And
upon Elizabeth's seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed looks, about
to escape, she added, "Lizzy, I _insist_ upon your staying and hearing
Mr. That it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side, too, was
another very welcome surprise; for his chief wish at present, was to
have as little trouble in the business as possible. 9. Bennet, to whom they then turned, was not quite
so cordial. Bennet and Lydia are going in the carriage to
Meryton. The gentlemen arrived early; and, before Mrs. His behaviour to her sister was such, during dinner time, as shewed an
admiration of her, which, though more guarded than formerly, persuaded
Elizabeth, that if left wholly to himself, Jane's happiness, and his
own, would be speedily secured. Bennet sat looking and winking at
Elizabeth and Catherine for a considerable time, without making any
impression on them. Bennet, in short, was in very great spirits; she had seen enough of
Bingley's behaviour to Jane, to be convinced that she would get him at
last; and her expectations of advantage to her family, when in a happy
humour, were so far beyond reason, that she was quite disappointed at
not seeing him there again the next day, to make his proposals. and Mrs. They were off Saturday night about twelve, as

acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself. There was too much to
be thought; and felt, and said, for attention to any other objects. Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of
passing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and was too
much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas
was his neighbour, till Sir William thus began. "I have been thinking it over again, Elizabeth," said her uncle, as they
drove from the town; "and really, upon serious consideration, I am much
more inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does of the
matter. F. But his anger, I am persuaded, lasted no longer than he remained
in any doubt of your sister's sentiments. It is such a spur to one's genius, such an
opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind. ) "Well, so much the better. --Elizabeth was in agonies. Make haste, make haste. There is no talk of his

train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to,
made her perhaps almost as happy as Jane. You need not send them word at

"You are very cruel," said her sister, "you will not let me smile, and

the whole of the matter; secondly, she was very sure that Mr. She does not yet leave her dressing-room. He was growing quite
inattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her. And yet, upon my honour, I
believed what I said of myself to be true, and I believe it at this
moment. Collins
received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure, and then
proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview, with the result
of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied, since the
refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow
from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character. The feelings
of the person who wrote, and the person who received it, are now so
widely different from what they were then, that every unpleasant
circumstance attending it, ought to be forgotten. Not these two or three years perhaps. Now be sincere;

"For the liveliness of your mind, I did. She could neither
wonder nor condemn, but the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing
consolatory to her bosom, afforded no palliation of her distress. Miss Bingley's civility to Elizabeth increased at last
very rapidly, as well as her affection for Jane; and when they parted,
after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to
see her either at Longbourn or Netherfield, and embracing her most
tenderly, she even shook hands with the former. When convinced on that article, Miss Bennet had nothing
farther to wish. His character was decided. The park was very large, and contained great variety of ground. are

her last letter to her friend from Longbourn, had by some accident been
lost. "

"Your list of the common extent of accomplishments," said Darcy, "has
too much truth. A small sum could not do all this. Hope was over, entirely over; and when Jane could attend to the rest of
the letter, she found little, except the professed affection of the
writer, that could give her any comfort. But I believe your opinion of him would in general
astonish--and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly
anywhere else. Bingley was the principal spokesman, and Miss Bennet the
principal object. And their
mother had the satisfaction of knowing, that she should be able to shew
her married daughter in the neighbourhood, before she was banished to
the North. I shall never be quite happy till I
     have been all round the park. "

"You did! and it was not wholly without foundation. But Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every prospect
of her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on her
spirits; and having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas, whom she had
not seen for a week, she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to
the oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her particular
notice. Bingley called again, and alone. Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners were very much admired at the parsonage,
and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of
their engagements at Rosings. Lakes, mountains,

He then told her of Georgiana's delight in her acquaintance, and of her
disappointment at its sudden interruption; which naturally leading to
the cause of that interruption, she soon learnt that his resolution of
following her from Derbyshire in quest of her sister, had been formed
before he quitted the inn, and that his gravity and thoughtfulness
there, had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must
comprehend. I was uncomfortable enough. She asked her at different times, how many sisters
she had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether any of
them were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where they
had been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been her
mother's maiden name?--Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her
questions, but answered them very composedly. "Of music! Then pray speak aloud. But it ought to
be done, and if you will give me a sheet of paper, it shall be done
directly. "

"That is very true," replied Elizabeth, "and I could easily forgive
_his_ pride, if he had not mortified _mine_. Egerton,
Military Library, Whitehall. There--I have saved you the trouble of accounting for it;
and really, all things considered, I begin to think it perfectly
reasonable. They crossed it by a simple bridge, in character with the general air of
the scene; it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and
the valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed room only for the
stream, and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered
it. I hope I never ridicule what is wise or good. "

Elizabeth's spirits were so high on the occasion, that though she did
not often speak unnecessarily to Mr. Gardiner could do. Darcy took up a book; Miss Bingley did the same;
and Mrs. It amazes
me, I confess;--for certainly, there can be nothing so advantageous to
them as instruction. Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs. Collins to join his daughters in their
walk; and Mr. To Jane, he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused, and
whose merit she had undervalued; but to her own more extensive
information, he was the person, to whom the whole family were indebted
for the first of benefits, and whom she regarded herself with an
interest, if not quite so tender, at least as reasonable and just, as
what Jane felt for Bingley. Darcy
had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance. --But I tell you what, Miss Lizzy, if you take
it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way,
you will never get a husband at all--and I am sure I do not know who is
to maintain you when your father is dead. Her affections had been continually
fluctuating, but never without an object. [Illustration: DOVE-DALE]




PRIDE & PREJUDICE. Hurst sang with her sister, and while they were thus employed
Elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some music books
that lay on the instrument, how frequently Mr. He promises fairly, and I hope among different people,
     where they may each have a character to preserve, they will both be
     more prudent. Mrs. Mr. "

At that moment they were met from another walk, by Mrs. Darcy's next step was
     to make your uncle acquainted with it, and he first called in
     Gracechurch-street the evening before I came home. To donate, please visit:  www. It is not the object of this work to give a description of Derbyshire,
nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither
lay; Oxford, Blenheim, Warwick, Kenelworth, Birmingham, &c. But the gloom of Lydia's prospect was shortly cleared away; for she
received an invitation from Mrs. Darcy corroborated it with a bow, and
was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on Elizabeth, when they
were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger, and Elizabeth
happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other,
was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting. --But their
father, though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure, was really
glad to see them; he had felt their importance in the family circle. Darcy rise also and follow him, and her agitation on seeing it was
extreme. The
liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value!"

She was now, on being settled at home, at leisure to observe the real
state of her sister's spirits. It was, moreover, such a promising thing for her younger
daughters, as Jane's marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of
other rich men; and lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of life to be
able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister, that
she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked. "

"I must not decide on my own performance. You supposed more than
     really existed. 4. As to
his real character, had information been in her power, she had never
felt a wish of enquiring. Every day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety; but the most anxious
part of each was when the post was expected. The old lady is Mrs. "

"We will be down as soon as we can," said Jane; "but I dare say Kitty is
forwarder than either of us, for she went up stairs half an hour ago. I wish I could see her. She had not at first thought very seriously of
going thither; but Charlotte, she soon found, was depending on the plan,
and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure
as well as greater certainty. She felt anew the justice of Mr. "It must not be thought of. "

"Is my father in town?"

"Yes, he went on Tuesday as I wrote you word. Darcy's character, though he had assured her that respect for the
father, would always prevent his exposing the son. Mr. They agreed that Mrs. Collins listened to her
with the determined air of following his own inclination, and when she
ceased speaking, replied thus,

"My dear Miss Elizabeth, I have the highest opinion in the world of your
excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your
understanding, but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference
between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity, and those
which regulate the clergy; for give me leave to observe that I consider
the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank
in the kingdom--provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the
same time maintained. "

Mr. I shall offer to pay him to-morrow; he will rant and storm about
his love for you, and there will be an end of the matter. She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings,
and had sent for him only the Saturday before, to make up her pool of
quadrille in the evening. At night she opened her heart to Jane. "

"Neither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude," replied Elizabeth, "have any
possible claim on me, in the present instance. "I have an excessive regard for Jane Bennet, she is really a very sweet
girl, and I wish with all my heart she were well settled. I
hope he will overlook it. Good Heaven! Brighton, and a whole
campful of soldiers, to us, who have been overset already by one poor
regiment of militia, and the monthly balls of Meryton. They
had nothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably had, and if
not, it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small
market-town, where the family did not visit. 1. Does she live near you, sir?"

"The garden in which stands my humble abode, is separated only by a lane
from Rosings Park, her ladyship's residence. 'Lady
Catherine,' said she, 'you have given me a treasure. As soon as they were gone, Elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits;
or in other words, to dwell without interruption on those subjects that
must deaden them more. Such were the gentle murmurs of Mrs. Mrs. It is very often nothing but
our own vanity that deceives us. James's, Sir William was so completely
awed, by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had but just courage
enough to make a very low bow, and take his seat without saying a word;
and his daughter, frightened almost out of her senses, sat on the edge
of her chair, not knowing which way to look. "

"How can you contrive to write so even?"

He was silent. However, your coming just at this time is the
greatest of comforts, and I am very glad to hear what you tell us, of
long sleeves. She began at length to recover, to
fidget about in her chair, get up, sit down again, wonder, and bless
herself. "

"_That_ is a failing indeed!"--cried Elizabeth. Their society can afford no pleasure,
that will atone for such wretchedness as this! Let me never see either
one or the other again!"

Yet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer no
compensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from observing
how much the beauty of her sister re-kindled the admiration of her
former lover. He

all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs,
absurd and impertinent. "And then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my sisters
behind you; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the
winter is over. You
may have drawn him in. She was quite amazed
at her own discomposure; but amongst other causes of disquiet, she
dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in
her favour; and more than commonly anxious to please, she naturally
suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her. "

"If you mean Darcy," cried her brother, "he may go to bed, if he chuses,
before it begins--but as for the ball, it is quite a settled thing; and
as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough I shall send round my
cards. "

Elizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he assented to his
cousin's praise; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she
discern any symptom of love; and from the whole of his behaviour to Miss
De Bourgh she derived this comfort for Miss Bingley, that he might have
been just as likely to marry _her_, had she been his relation. I promised
them so faithfully! What will Wickham say? It was to be such a secret!"

"If it was to be secret," said Jane, "say not another word on the
subject. But let me advise you to think better of it. Darcy was really the
object of her choice, by explaining the gradual change which her
estimation of him had undergone, relating her absolute certainty that
his affection was not the work of a day, but had stood the test of many
months suspense, and enumerating with energy all his good qualities, she
did conquer her father's incredulity, and reconcile him to the match. "

"Oh! where, where is my uncle?" cried Elizabeth, darting from her seat
as she finished the letter, in eagerness to follow him, without losing a
moment of the time so precious; but as she reached the door, it was
opened by a servant, and Mr. E. "Yes, she called yesterday with her father. She felt it so; and though, in
looking forward, neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity,
could be justly expected for her sister; in looking back to what they
had feared, only two hours ago, she felt all the advantages of what they
had gained. "

Mr. "

Elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt persuaded
of her sister's ready acquiescence. She cared for none
     of her friends, she wanted no help of his, she would not hear of
     leaving Wickham. "

"Kitty has no discretion in her coughs," said her father; "she times
them ill. Bennet's eyes sparkled with pleasure, and she was
eagerly calling out, while her daughter read,

"Well, Jane, who is it from? what is it about? what does he say? Well,
Jane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love. Mrs. Miss Bennet was therefore
established as a sweet girl, and their brother felt authorised by such
commendation to think of her as he chose. She is a
very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance, Mrs. CHAPTER V. No
     arguments shall be wanting on my part, that can alleviate so severe
     a misfortune; or that may comfort you, under a circumstance that
     must be of all others most afflicting to a parent's mind. At present I will
say nothing about it. Collins by Jane's introduction of him. Your sisters are engaged, and there is not
another woman in the room, whom it would not be a punishment to me to
stand up with. He had been some days in town, before he was able to
     discover them; but he had something to direct his search, which was
     more than _we_ had; and the consciousness of this, was another
     reason for his resolving to follow us. "With my mother up stairs. "

"We will go as far as Meryton with you," said Catherine and
Lydia. Gardiner were half a quarter of a
mile behind. A great deal more passed at the
other table. Bingley's large fortune, the mention of which gave animation to their
mother, was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of
an ensign. "

"Upon my word, Sir," cried Elizabeth, "your hope is rather an
extraordinary one after my declaration. The
happiness which this reply produced, was such as he had probably never
felt before; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as
warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do. Darcy, only for a few minutes to take
leave, but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least
an hour, hoping for her return, and almost resolving to walk after her
till she could be found. "

It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now. You have sense, and we all
expect you to use it. Let us hope, therefore, that her being
there may teach her her own insignificance. Bingley and Jane were standing together, a little detached from the
rest, and talked only to each other. Wickham was to
     the last so steady, that in his will he particularly recommended it
     to me, to promote his advancement in the best manner that his
     profession might allow, and if he took orders, desired that a
     valuable family living might be his as soon as soon as it became
     vacant. The supposition did not pain her. Darcy with grave propriety requested to be allowed the honour of her
hand; but in vain. Darcy's letter, nor explain to her sister how sincerely she
had been valued by his friend. "

"Is this a hint to me, Lizzy," said her father, "to send for the
horses?"

"No, indeed. My aunt told me so
herself on Saturday. They were confined for the evening at different tables, and she had
nothing to hope, but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side
of the room, as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself. Lady Catherine rose also, and they turned
back. Thoughtlessness,
want of attention to other people's feelings, and want of resolution,
will do the business. --I did not believe her to be
     indifferent because I wished it;--I believed it on impartial
     conviction, as truly as I wished it in reason. I always said it must be so, at last. --I hope there was. Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns. "

"And do you like her?"

"Very much. Mr. "

"We are not in a way to know _what_ Mr. She coloured as she spoke; but neither that, nor any thing
else, awakened a suspicion of the truth. *       *       *       *       *

"Good gracious!" cried Mrs. "

"Oh!--Your uncle!--He keeps a man-servant, does he?--I am very glad you
have somebody who thinks of those things. Will you come and see me?"

"We shall often meet, I hope, in Hertfordshire. "

"I beg your pardon," replied Miss Bingley, turning away with a sneer. Mr. Miss Darcy looked as if she
wished for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes did venture a
short sentence, when there was least danger of its being heard. "

Mrs. Mrs. While the contents of the first
letter remained on her mind, she was all surprise--all astonishment that
Wickham should marry a girl, whom it was impossible he could marry for
money; and how Lydia could ever have attached him, had appeared
incomprehensible. A military life is not what I was intended for, but circumstances have
now made it eligible. Is not it so, Mrs. His behaviour to us has,
     in every respect, been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire. Bingley and his sisters came to give their
personal invitation for the long expected ball at Netherfield, which was
fixed for the following Tuesday. When I last saw her, she was not very promising. Having now a good house and very sufficient income, he intended to
marry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he had
a wife in view, as he meant to chuse one of the daughters, if he found
them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report. Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject; and
affectionately taking her hand, said in reply,

"Do not make yourself uneasy, my love. It is a pity they are not handsome! Not that _I_ think
Charlotte so _very_ plain--but then she is our particular friend. "

"You have only proved by this," cried Elizabeth, "that Mr. She was
sorry that Mr. "Well, mamma," said she, when they were all returned to the breakfast
room, "and what do you think of my husband? Is not he a charming man? I
am sure my sisters must all envy me. Collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had passed. He repeated the question, with some
surprise at her silence. --Many
stared. " She then sat still five
minutes longer; but unable to waste such a precious occasion, she
suddenly got up, and saying to Kitty,

"Come here, my love, I want to speak to you," took her out of the room. Jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the
society of her two friends, and the attentions of their brother; and
Elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr. Not like the wild young men now-a-days, who think of nothing but
themselves. The justice of the charge struck her too forcibly
for denial, and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded, as
having passed at the Netherfield ball, and as confirming all his first
disapprobation, could not have made a stronger impression on his mind
than on hers. 9. The next was in these words. Jane resolutely
kept her place at the table; but Elizabeth, to satisfy her mother, went
to the window--she looked,--she saw Mr. "

No one made any reply. Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U. Miss Bingley offered her the carriage, and she only
wanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane testified such concern
in parting with her, that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer
of the chaise into an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the
present. Wickham has created, a
     suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his
     real character. Ignorant as you previously were of every thing
     concerning either, detection could not be in your power, and
     suspicion certainly not in your inclination. It was consequently necessary to
name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity; to have
some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed, and by
again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation, console herself for the
present, and prepare for another disappointment. With such rivals for the notice of the fair, as Mr. Nobody can tell what I
suffer!--But it is always so. "Oh! Lizzy, why am I thus singled from my family, and blessed
above them all! If I could but see _you_ as happy! If there _were_ but
such another man for you!"

"If you were to give me forty such men, I never could be so happy as
you. Collins and myself on
this happy event, let me now add a short hint on the subject of another:
of which we have been advertised by the same authority. Her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in
her way. "

With such kind of histories of their parties and good jokes, did Lydia,
assisted by Kitty's hints and additions, endeavour to amuse her
companions all the way to Longbourn. "

"And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry? Did he know of
their intending to go off? Had Colonel Forster seen Denny himself?"

"Yes; but when questioned by _him_ Denny denied knowing any thing of
their plan, and would not give his real opinion about it. "He must be an oddity, I think," said she. She is quite a little
creature. He was struggling for the
appearance of composure, and would not open his lips, till he believed
himself to have attained it. He is nothing to us, you know, and I am sure
_I_ never want to see him again. "And _that_ I suppose is one of your sisters. I was ready to die of laughter. It was reasonable, however, to
hope, that they would not continue long. Darcy, and Lizzy, and Kitty," said Mrs. Of Mr. Collins made his
declaration in form. Whatever bears affinity to cunning is
despicable. My daughter and my
nephew are formed for each other. While settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound of the
door bell, and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its
being Colonel Fitzwilliam himself, who had once before called late in
the evening, and might now come to enquire particularly after her. I have been a disappointed man, and
my spirits will not bear solitude. "




CHAPTER VI. Ring the bell,
Kitty, for Hill. Our
importance, our respectability in the world, must be affected by the
wild volatility, the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark
Lydia's character. "

She then ran gaily off, rejoicing as she rambled about, in the hope of
being at home again in a day or two. Darcy, that they scarcely ever saw him. I shall send for my
     clothes when I get to Longbourn; but I wish you would tell Sally
     to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown, before they are
     packed up. I know you will do him such ample justice, that I am
growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent. "

Mr. As for Wickham and Lydia, their characters suffered no revolution from
the marriage of her sisters. Mr. He took the hint,
and when Mary had finished her second song, said aloud,

"That will do extremely well, child. "

"Mr. I thought I should have broke my heart. Did you see him while you were at Lambton? I thought I
understood from the Gardiners that you had. Darcy could be so unworthy of Mr. E. She continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of Lady
Catherine's carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter
Charlotte's observation, and hurried her away to her room. Bingley with having promised on his first coming
into the country to give a ball at Netherfield. Kitty is slight and delicate, and Mary studies so much, that her hours
of repose should not be broken in on. When all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen,
they returned down stairs, and taking leave of the housekeeper, were
consigned over to the gardener, who met them at the hall door. Bingley, she had likewise seen for an instant, and in that short period
saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed. If you should have no objection to receive me
     into your house, I propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on
     you and your family, Monday, November 18th, by four o'clock, and
     shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the Saturday
     se'night following, which I can do without any inconvenience, as
     Lady Catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a
     Sunday, provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the
     duty of the day. The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no
otherwise than by netting a purse, or covering a skreen. "I would not on any
account trifle with her affectionate solicitude; or allow her to hear it
from any one but myself. I have a warm, unguarded temper, and I
may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion _of_ him, and _to_ him, too
freely. But I hope you will not mind it: it is
all for Jane's sake, you know; and there is no occasion for talking to
him, except just now and then. Poor
Jane! I am sorry for her, because, with her disposition, she may not get
over it immediately. That tall, proud man. Reflection must be
reserved for solitary hours; whenever she was alone, she gave way to it
as the greatest relief; and not a day went by without a solitary walk,
in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant
recollections. When first
he entered the corps, she was ready enough to admire him; but so we all
were. She had dressed with more than
usual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all
that remained unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more than
might be won in the course of the evening. B. She has known him only a fortnight. It was drawn at the same time as the
other--about eight years ago. Bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the sense of
their father and mother. Darcy had been staying there. Darcy about it,
     if you had rather not. "

"This account then is what he has received from Mr. Its business office is located at 809
North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. "

"Your surprise could not be greater than _mine_ in being noticed by you. --That they might have met without ill consequence, is
     perhaps probable;--but his regard did not appear to me enough
     extinguished for him to see her without some danger. Collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary. Darcy. F. "

"But if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never be
required. --But to be guarded at such a time, is
very difficult. But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man, whom
they had never seen before, of most gentleman-like appearance, walking
with an officer on the other side of the way. Mrs. "

"My object _then_," replied Darcy, "was to shew you, by every civility
in my power, that I was not so mean as to resent the past; and I hoped
to obtain your forgiveness, to lessen your ill opinion, by letting you
see that your reproofs had been attended to. When the first
transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were
over, he naturally returned to all his former indolence. Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving any
one; and all that I can hope in this case is, that she is deceived
herself. From his garden, Mr. Nothing could
console and nothing appease her. He still loves me, and we are
engaged. If you and Miss
Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall be very
thankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me. Robinson's asking him how he liked our Meryton
assemblies, and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty
women in the room, and _which_ he thought the prettiest? and his
answering immediately to the last question--Oh! the eldest Miss Bennet
beyond a doubt, there cannot be two opinions on that point. "I have no reason, I assure you," said he, "to be dissatisfied with my
reception. Such relief, however, as it was in her power to afford, by the practice
of what might be called economy in her own private expences, she
frequently sent them. Well, if they can be easy with an
estate that is not lawfully their own, so much the better. "They
will join me early to-morrow," he continued, "and among them are some
who will claim an acquaintance with you,--Mr. The others then joined her, and expressed their admiration of his
figure; but Elizabeth heard not a word, and, wholly engrossed by her own
feelings, followed them in silence. That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over a
ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assembly
brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate. Bennet's invention was again at work to get
every body away from him and her daughter. What I have to say relates to
     poor Lydia. It was next to impossible that their cousin should
come in a scarlet coat, and it was now some weeks since they had
received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour. The distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly. "If they had uncles enough to fill _all_ Cheapside," cried Bingley, "it
would not make them one jot less agreeable. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project

at Mr. --What advantage can it be to you
to offend Mr. Mr. Miss Darcy's praise occupied
the chief of it. "

"Oh!--you mean Jane, I suppose--because he danced with her twice. "

"Yes, indeed," cried Mrs. Darcy's
sometimes coming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park,
she turned up the lane, which led her farther from the turnpike road. Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you for
being simply dressed. Wickham is the son of a very
     respectable man, who had for many years the management of all the
     Pemberley estates; and whose good conduct in the discharge of his
     trust, naturally inclined my father to be of service to him, and on
     George Wickham, who was his god-son, his kindness was therefore
     liberally bestowed. CHAPTER VII. Darcy is over, I presume," said Miss
Bingley;--"and pray what is the result?"

"I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr. Bennet, who fancied she had gained a complete
victory over him, continued her triumph. In no countenance was attentive
curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley's, in spite of the
smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its
objects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her attentions
to Mr. In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother's
words, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible
whisper; for to her inexpressible vexation, she could perceive that the
chief of it was overheard by Mr. "

"I do not believe Mrs. My father and mother knew nothing of that, they only felt how
imprudent a match it must be. On Saturday he came again. After
pausing on this point a considerable while, she once more continued to
read. This idea
lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view; the
turning past, he was immediately before them. "If one could but go to Brighton!" observed Mrs. The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently
characteristic. Collins for
a few moments, he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation
were very intimately acquainted with the family of de Bourgh. Darcy would connect himself with a family, where to every other
objection would now be added, an alliance and relationship of the
nearest kind with the man whom he so justly scorned. Jane should
therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his
attention. London:
Printed for T. "

"I will not be interrupted. _I_ never saw such capacity, and taste, and
application, and elegance, as you describe, united. Her tour to the Lakes
was now the object of her happiest thoughts; it was her best consolation
for all the uncomfortable hours, which the discontentedness of her
mother and Kitty made inevitable; and could she have included Jane in
the scheme, every part of it would have been perfect. She endeavoured to secure Jane in
her interest, but Jane with all possible mildness declined
interfering;--and Elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and
sometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacks. "

Elizabeth made no objection;--the door was then allowed to be shut, and
the carriage drove off. Collins and
     myself sincerely sympathise with you, and all your respectable
     family, in your present distress, which must be of the bitterest
     kind, because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove. She had only to say in
reply, that they had wandered about, till she was beyond her own
knowledge. Yet he knew to the contrary himself. He meant to provide for me amply,
and thought he had done it; but when the living fell, it was given
elsewhere. Lydia has no
brothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my father's
behaviour, from his indolence and the little attention he has ever
seemed to give to what was going forward in his family, that _he_ would
do as little, and think as little about it, as any father could do, in
such a matter. Bennet," said she, "it is very hard to think that Charlotte
Lucas should ever be mistress of this house, that I should be forced to
make way for _her_, and live to see her take my place in it!"

"My dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts. "

Not yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her husband, did
Mrs. Jane now came up. His pride, in that direction,
may be of service, if not to himself, to many others, for it must deter
him from such foul misconduct as I have suffered by. The
possibility of meeting Mr. For herself she was humbled; but she was proud of him. Mr. Her many attractions were again dwelt on, and Caroline
boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy, and ventured to predict
the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former
letter. It was over at last however. "

"There is some sense in what he says about the girls however; and if he
is disposed to make them any amends, I shall not be the person to
discourage him. Elizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in
attending to what passed between Darcy and his companion. Darcy more than once, but he believes that it was left to
him _conditionally_ only. But I can assure the young ladies that I come
prepared to admire them. Philips were now productive of the most interesting
intelligence. "

"You judge very properly," said Mr. I
shall now know how to act. CHAPTER XV. But
     last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice. "Don't keep coughing so, Kitty, for heaven's sake! Have a little
compassion on my nerves. We all love to
instruct, though we can teach only what is not worth knowing. Forster,
the delight of Mrs. "

Elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was
the case, and with equal sincerity could add that she firmly believed
and rejoiced in his domestic comforts. Wickham, and of seeing a confirmation of every thing in Mr. Darcy:--but let me not interrupt you,
Sir. Darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter. With _your_
good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of
others! Affectation of candour is common enough;--one meets it every
where. Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr. The children, two girls of six and eight years old, and two
younger boys, were to be left under the particular care of their cousin
Jane, who was the general favourite, and whose steady sense and
sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every
way--teaching them, playing with them, and loving them. It is not to be supposed
that there was much affection in the case. "

This letter gave Elizabeth some pain; but her spirits returned as she
considered that Jane would no longer be duped, by the sister at least. She had
gained her point, and had time to consider of it. There
could not exist in the world _two_ men, over whom Mr. II. "

"No--why should he? If it was not allowable for him to gain _my_
affections, because I had no money, what occasion could there be for
making love to a girl whom he did not care about, and who was equally
poor?"

"But there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her, so
soon after this event. But he found, in reply to
     this question, that Wickham still cherished the hope of more
     effectually making his fortune by marriage, in some other country. --How it could occur a second time therefore was
very odd!--Yet it did, and even a third. I roused, and
interested you, because I was so unlike _them_. --He carved, and ate, and praised with delighted
alacrity; and every dish was commended, first by him, and then by Sir
William, who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son in law
said, in a manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear. In the hall they parted. It makes me very nervous and poorly, to be thwarted
so in my own family, and to have neighbours who think of themselves
before anybody else. But will they make you happy?"

"Have you any other objection," said Elizabeth, "than your belief of my
indifference?"

"None at all. By many significant looks and silent
entreaties, did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of
complaisance,--but in vain; Mary would not understand them; such an
opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song. You deserve no such attention. Perhaps I am not doing her justice. But, alas! the story which followed of his designs on Miss Darcy,
received some confirmation from what had passed between Colonel
Fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before; and at last she was
referred for the truth of every particular to Colonel Fitzwilliam
himself--from whom she had previously received the information of his
near concern in all his cousin's affairs, and whose character she had no
reason to question. Jane listened with astonishment and concern;--she
knew not how to believe that Mr. They repulsed
every attempt of Mrs. Darcy, however, should
have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough, and
she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman, or
the insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable. She was afraid of talking longer of his
friend; and, having nothing else to say, was now determined to leave the
trouble of finding a subject to him. "He is as fine a fellow," said Mr. "

Miss Bingley made no answer; and soon afterwards got up and walked about
the room. Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought
to do?"

"Oh, yes! You will only think I feel _more_ than I ought to do, when I
tell you all. That he is
as false and deceitful, as he is insinuating. If I were not afraid of judging harshly, I should
     be almost tempted to say, that there is a strong appearance of
     duplicity in all this. They soon outstripped the others, and when they had
reached the carriage, Mr. The business was therefore soon settled. "

"I think you said she was a widow, sir? has she any family?"

"She has one only daughter, the heiress of Rosings, and of very
extensive property. A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de
Bourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant; and the respect which he
felt for her high rank, and his veneration for her as his patroness,
mingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his authority as a
clergyman, and his rights as a rector, made him altogether a mixture of
pride and obsequiousness, self-importance and humility. "They have both," said she, "been deceived, I dare say, in some way or
other, of which we can form no idea. He had found the law a most unprofitable study,
     and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained, if I would
     present him to the living in question--of which he trusted there
     could be little doubt, as he was well assured that I had no other
     person to provide for, and I could not have forgotten my revered
     father's intentions. Mrs. The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States. Darcy just deigned to return. Their reception from Mr. Gardiner? He has been here
this half hour, and master has had a letter. He is rich, to be
sure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than Jane. Reynolds
was of no trifling nature. You have no compassion on my poor nerves. CHAPTER V. The church _ought_ to have been my profession--I
was brought up for the church, and I should at this time have been in
possession of a most valuable living, had it pleased the gentleman we
were speaking of just now. Accordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the chambermaid
whether Pemberley were not a very fine place, what was the name of its
proprietor, and with no little alarm, whether the family were down for
the summer. Mr. Bingley was by no means deficient,
but Darcy was clever. This is my advice. Why does she not come in?"

"Oh! Charlotte says, she hardly ever does. In anticipating the happiness of Bingley,
which of course was to be inferior only to his own, he continued the
conversation till they reached the house. I should be sorry, you know,
to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in Derbyshire. I cannot find
out that I hate her at all, or that I am in the least unwilling to think
her a very good sort of girl. I really do not think Georgiana
Darcy has her equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments; and the
affection she inspires in Louisa and myself, is heightened into
something still more interesting, from the hope we dare to entertain of
her being hereafter our sister. and
Mrs. Darcy, who never looks at any
woman but to see a blemish, and who probably never looked at _you_ in
his life! It is admirable!"

Elizabeth tried to join in her father's pleasantry, but could only force
one most reluctant smile. They will have nothing else to
do. Had she merely _dined_ with him, she might
only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must
remember that four evenings have been also spent together--and four
evenings may do a great deal. "

"But if you have got them to-day," said Elizabeth, "my mother's purpose
will be answered. "

"Mr. As her successor in that house, she
regarded her with jealous abhorrence. When the engagement was for home, some of the officers always
made part of it, of which officers Mr. --Pray, what is your age?"

"With three younger sisters grown up," replied Elizabeth smiling, "your
Ladyship can hardly expect me to own it. He spoke of it as a certain event,
     of which the time alone could be undecided. "She is so fond of Mrs. But whatever may be the sentiments which Mr. Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth
again, having still a great deal to say to her, and many enquiries to
make after all their Hertfordshire friends. The Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the
world, though only a few weeks before, when Lydia had first run away,
they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune. "

Then, perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying, she added,
"Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia, we may draw from it this useful
lesson; that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable--that one false
step involves her in endless ruin--that her reputation is no less
brittle than it is beautiful,--and that she cannot be too much guarded
in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex. She felt that she had no business at
Pemberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it. In this danger Kitty
is also comprehended. Recovering himself, however, shortly,
he turned to his partner, and said,

"Sir William's interruption has made me forget what we were talking of. Collins was first introduced to her
notice, but he certainly has not known her long. Bingley's attentions to her sister, Elizabeth
was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some
interest in the eyes of his friend. In Three Volumes. Darcy with him, and sat down
again by her sister. I must confess myself
     surprised by your application; I did not expect it from _you_. "While Mary is adjusting her ideas," he continued, "let us return to Mr. One seems so forlorn without them. "

"Indeed you are mistaken. With assumed tranquillity he then replied, "I have no wish of denying
that I did every thing in my power to separate my friend from your
sister, or that I rejoice in my success. "

Mr. Darcy were by no means over. Bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for Lydia's
interruption, and promised that it should not occur again, if he would
resume his book; but Mr. Mr. Darcy; the latter of whom, however,
could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of _her_, in spite of
all Miss Bingley's witticisms on _fine eyes_. "

Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it, and
they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put
an end to cards; and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr. Wickham is safe. --Your mother will never see you
again if you do _not_ marry Mr. But perhaps Mr. Darcy had at first scarcely
allowed her to be pretty; he had looked at her without admiration at the
ball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise. All the world are good and agreeable
in your eyes. gutenberg. --Miss Darcy, the daughter of Mr. E. Bennet rejoiced to see Jane
in undiminished beauty; and more than once during dinner did Mr. Collins for the knowledge of what carriages went
along, and how often especially Miss De Bourgh drove by in her phaeton,
which he never failed coming to inform them of, though it happened
almost every day. Into _one_ house in this
neighbourhood, they shall never have admittance. Darcy had been at her
sister's wedding. These
were the contents:

     "MY DEAR HARRIET,

     "You will laugh when you know where I am gone, and I cannot help
     laughing myself at your surprise to-morrow morning, as soon as I am
     missed. So imprudent a
     match on both sides!--But I am willing to hope the best, and that
     his character has been misunderstood. She answered in the affirmative, and, unable to resist
the temptation, added, "When you met us there the other day, we had just
been forming a new acquaintance. Bennet, was not so well pleased with it. My dear Jane, Mr. I must find Mr. My courage always rises with every attempt to
intimidate me. GARDINER. Her father was walking about the room, looking grave and anxious. Pray go to see them, with Sir William and Maria. Such very
superior dancing is not often seen. Bennet's expectations were fully answered. Jenkinson was
arranging Miss de Bourgh's foot-stool, that she said, 'Mr. "You either chuse this method of passing
the evening because you are in each other's confidence and have secret
affairs to discuss, or because you are conscious that your figures
appear to the greatest advantage in walking;--if the first, I should be
completely in your way;--and if the second, I can admire you much better
as I sit by the fire. "

But Jane could think with certainty on only one point,--that Mr. Collins and Lizzy. "

"No," said Colonel Fitzwilliam, "that is an advantage which he must
divide with me. Believe her to be deceived by all means. gutenberg. I have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will
include you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she
honours us during your stay here. "

"Nay, if you are so serious about it, I shall consider the matter as
absolutely settled. "

"It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire. I cannot think of it without abhorrence. Collins met for breakfast a few
minutes before the others appeared; and he took the opportunity of
paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary. --"Louisa, you will not mind my
waking Mr. "

Mrs. "Do
you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on
them, as nonsense? I cannot quite agree with you _there_. Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday; on Tuesday, his wife received a
letter from him; it told them, that on his arrival, he had immediately
found out his brother, and persuaded him to come to Gracechurch street. With a
book he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a
good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised
such splendid expectations. But
Lizzy, you have been very sly, very reserved with me. They have at
least that advantage. As soon as they entered the copse, Lady Catherine began in the following
manner:--

"You can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to understand the reason of my
journey hither. Bennet
was restored to her usual querulous serenity, and by the middle of June
Kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton without
tears; an event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth hope, that by
the following Christmas, she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to
mention an officer above once a day, unless by some cruel and malicious
arrangement at the war-office, another regiment should be quartered in
Meryton. Collins, was convinced that
they were talking of the Longbourn estate, and resolving to turn herself
and her daughters out of the house, as soon as Mr. F. Indeed, Mr. Elizabeth soon heard from her friend; and their
correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been; that it
should be equally unreserved was impossible. It was
generally evident whenever they met, that he _did_ admire her; and to
_her_ it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference
which she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a
way to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it
was not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since Jane
united with great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and a
uniform cheerfulness of manner, which would guard her from the
suspicions of the impertinent. E. But in all, and in almost every line of each, there was a want of that
cheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style, and which,
proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself, and kindly
disposed towards every one, had been scarcely ever clouded. "

"Insolent girl!" said Elizabeth to herself. Your
     father was gone, your uncle at home, and, as I said before, they
     had a great deal of talk together. Darcy,
she saw on looking up that Colonel Fitzwilliam was meeting her. Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the

she did not believe herself, that his attentions to Jane had been merely
the effect of a common and transient liking, which ceased when he saw
her no more; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at
the time, she had the same story to repeat every day. "

"You have a very small park here," returned Lady Catherine after a short
silence. The family were assembled in the breakfast room, to receive
them. She was met in the vestibule by Lydia, who, flying to
her, cried in a half whisper, "I am glad you are come, for there is such
fun here!--What do you think has happened this morning?--Mr. Darcy," observed Miss Bingley, in a half whisper,
"that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine
eyes. I have known him
too long and too well to be a fair judge. He shall not be in love with me, if I
can prevent it. Bennet, and
we shall very soon settle it with her, I am sure. Mr. Darcy's explanation
_there_, had appeared very insufficient; and she read it again. That among his own connections he was
esteemed and valued--that even Wickham had allowed him merit as a
brother, and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of
his sister as to prove him capable of _some_ amiable feeling. "I am by no means of opinion, I assure you," said he, "that a ball of
this kind, given by a young man of character, to respectable people, can
have any evil tendency; and I am so far from objecting to dancing myself
that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins
in the course of the evening, and I take this opportunity of soliciting
yours, Miss Elizabeth, for the two first dances especially,--a
preference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right
cause, and not to any disrespect for her. Do let me ask my partner to introduce you. Jane was already so much recovered
as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening. "

"I beg your pardon. Any thing beyond
the very neighbourhood of Longbourn, I suppose, would appear far. It settled the matter; and they pursued the accustomed
circuit; which brought them again, after some time, in a descent among
hanging woods, to the edge of the water, in one of its narrowest parts. (Robert William) Chapman

disagreeable?"

Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could; said that she had liked
him better when they met in Kent than before, and that she had never
seen him so pleasant as this morning. She has two nieces
of her own. Darcy is so violent,
that it would be the death of half the good people in Meryton, to
attempt to place him in an amiable light. Mr. There was certainly at this moment, in Elizabeth's mind, a more gentle
sensation towards the original, than she had ever felt in the height of
their acquaintance. What sister would think
herself at liberty to do it, unless there were something very
objectionable? If they believed him attached to me, they would not try
to part us; if he were so, they could not succeed. The moment of her release from
him was ecstacy. You were

1. Bennet from
fighting. The picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a
fourth. Collins no sooner saw the two
girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune, which
Charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked
to dine at Rosings the next day. 1. In a few minutes, Mrs. I dare say I shall
soon see them here. "

"No," replied Jane, "I have not forgotten him; but I have nothing
satisfactory to tell you. But she had never felt so
strongly as now, the disadvantages which must attend the children of so
unsuitable a marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils
arising from so ill-judged a direction of talents; talents which rightly
used, might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters,
even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife. But her mind was so busily engaged,
that she did not always know when she was silent. Where there is fortune to make the expence of
travelling unimportant, distance becomes no evil. U. Darcy. And when I returned home, the ----shire
was to leave Meryton in a week or fortnight's time. You do not look
well. Darcy soon drew the attention
of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien; and
the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after
his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year. Darcy before they
had known any thing of the matter. I happened to overhear the
gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of
this house the names of his cousin Miss de Bourgh, and of her mother
Lady Catherine. Jenkinson to make up her
party. Bennet, with great civility, begged her ladyship to take some
refreshment; but Lady Catherine very resolutely, and not very politely,
declined eating any thing; and then rising up, said to Elizabeth,

"Miss Bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness
on one side of your lawn. He is come--Mr. gutenberg. Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing
her, she could not tell, but he certainly had not seen her with
composure. --Come, Kitty, I want you up stairs. He was writing, and, without raising his head,
coolly replied,

"Just as you please. She dared not
even mention that gentleman. One has got all the goodness, and the other all the
appearance of it. "

"His manners are very different from his cousin's. You were disgusted with the women who were always speaking
and looking, and thinking for _your_ approbation alone. But, luckily, he came back
again in ten minutes time, and then we all set out. I
had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular, but I must
so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly
foolish. This, she would not hear of; but she was not so
unwilling to comply with their brother's proposal; and it was settled
that Mr. Nor was her respect for him, though it made her more quiet, at all
likely to make her more elegant. You may copy it, give it away or

preserved. There was no arguing upon such a project. His pride
never deserts him; but with the rich, he is liberal-minded, just,
sincere, rational, honourable, and perhaps agreeable,--allowing
something for fortune and figure. She related the subject
of the pictures, the dimensions of the rooms, and the price of the
furniture, in vain. Miss
Bingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the
first opportunity of saying, with sneering civility,

"Pray, Miss Eliza, are not the ----shire militia removed from Meryton?
They must be a great loss to _your_ family. Yet in spite of all these temptations, let me warn my cousin
Elizabeth, and yourself, of what evils you may incur, by a precipitate
closure with this gentleman's proposals, which, of course, you will be
inclined to take immediate advantage of. Darcy danced
only once with Mrs. I have a high respect for your nerves. "

"Unless where they like women of fortune, which I think they very often
do. "

"Mr. Annesley, a
genteel, agreeable-looking woman, whose endeavour to introduce some kind
of discourse, proved her to be more truly well bred than either of the
others; and between her and Mrs. Darcy may hug himself. "

"I have no right to give _my_ opinion," said Wickham, "as to his being
agreeable or otherwise. With _them_ he is remarkably
agreeable. You may depend upon my seeking no further. I can remember no symptom of affection on either
side; and had any thing of the kind been perceptible, you must be aware
that ours is not a family, on which it could be thrown away. Elizabeth's collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; and
as Miss Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not approach nearer to
Wickham, Georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be able
to speak any more. The Gardiners staid a week at Longbourn; and what with the Philipses,
the Lucases, and the officers, there was not a day without its
engagement. --It pains me to offend you. I shall not sport with your impatience, by reading what he says
on that point. Mr. I am sick of them all. Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to
supper; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the
others, and she had no opportunity of detaining them. "

"My dear Jane!" exclaimed Elizabeth, "you are too good. She had a sister married to a Mr. Could he expect that her friends
would not step forward? Could he expect to be noticed again by the
regiment, after such an affront to Colonel Forster? His temptation is
not adequate to the risk. But they were entirely ignorant of what had passed; and their raptures
continued with little intermission to the very day of Lydia's leaving
home. Though I
shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill; and if I was
her, I would not have put up with it. "MY DEAR BROTHER,

     "At last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece, and such
     as, upon the whole, I hope will give you satisfaction. I found that
Miss Darcy was expected to dinner. "

"Well, my dear," said Mr. Collins seemed neither in need
of encouragement, nor inclined to be silent himself. "

"Thank you--but I always mend my own. "It is a long time, Mr. And you saw the
old housekeeper, I suppose? Poor Reynolds, she was always very fond of
me. That the wish of giving happiness to you, might add force to the other
inducements which led me on, I shall not attempt to deny. Darcy, was one of the best men
that ever breathed, and the truest friend I ever had; and I can never be
in company with this Mr. And when
the party entered the assembly room, it consisted of only five
altogether; Mr. Happy shall I be, when his stay at Netherfield is over!"

"I wish I could say any thing to comfort you," replied Elizabeth; "but
it is wholly out of my power. Her answer, therefore, was not propitious, at
least not to Elizabeth's wishes, for she was impatient to get home. "It was greatly my wish that he should do so," he added, "as soon
     as his marriage was fixed on. You refuse, then, to oblige me. Gardiner and
her niece, however, did her justice, and pitied her. Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield
party. That _she_ could
be in any danger from the deception never entered my head. "He
only told me, what I have now told you. From something that he told me in
our journey hither, I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted to
him. Once or twice she could discern a faint blush; but in general
Charlotte wisely did not hear. "

It was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that embarrassment,
from which she had been so wholly free at first. Though I
_know_ it must be a scandalous falsehood; though I would not injure him
so much as to suppose the truth of it possible, I instantly resolved on
setting off for this place, that I might make my sentiments known to
you. He even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity. And now nothing
remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the
violence of my affection. Darcy then
was. _I_ should be
ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me. Her dirty petticoat
quite escaped my notice. And
     will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances
     to his creditors in Meryton, of whom I shall subjoin a list,
     according to his information. He had entertained hopes of being
admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had heard
much; but he saw only the father. Perhaps I
did not always love him so well as I do now. But I am particularly
attached to these young men; and know them to be so much attached to
me!--They were excessively sorry to go! But so they always are. Lady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew;
and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character, in
her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement, she sent him
language so very abusive, especially of Elizabeth, that for some time
all intercourse was at an end. "

Consoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear her
husband's incivility; though it was very mortifying to know that her
neighbours might all see Mr. All that is known after this is, that they were seen
     to continue the London road. "Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Very little was said by either; Kitty was
too much afraid of him to talk; Elizabeth was secretly forming a
desperate resolution; and perhaps he might be doing the same. They were ignorant, idle, and vain. Miss Bingley's letter arrived, and put an end to doubt. Could she have seen half as much love in Mr. Mrs. "

"What think you of books?" said he, smiling. They
had all been very ill-used since she last saw her sister. Bennet gone away, and I know he will fight
Wickham, wherever he meets him, and then he will be killed, and what is
to become of us all? The Collinses will turn us out, before he is cold
in his grave; and if you are not kind to us, brother, I do not know what
we shall do. "

Elizabeth's misery increased, at such unnecessary, such officious
attention! Were the same fair prospect to arise at present, as had
flattered them a year ago, every thing, she was persuaded, would be
hastening to the same vexatious conclusion. Darcy's behaviour astonished and vexed her. Four nieces
of Mrs. Every body is disgusted with his pride. Their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she could
regard with any complacency. "

"Can such abominable pride as his, have ever done him good?"

"Yes. The whole of what Elizabeth had already
heard, his claims on Mr. "

"I did not think you would;--and that being the case, I cannot consider
your situation with much compassion. "

But Elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with them,
laughingly answered,

"No, no; stay where you are. "

Elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he afterwards
took occasion to ask her, when unattended to by any of the rest,
whether _all_ her sisters were at Longbourn. --But
     from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally
     bestowed, respecting each circumstance, I shall hope to be in
     future secured, when the following account of my actions and their
     motives has been read. CHAPTER X. "There
is nothing the matter with me. At first there
seemed danger of Lydia's engrossing him entirely, for she was a most
determined talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets,
she soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making bets
and exclaiming after prizes, to have attention for any one in
particular. Bennet, "you
will wait on him of course. --Oh! had I known what
I ought, what I dared, to do! But I knew not--I was afraid of doing too
much. A
most delightful place!--Excellent Parsonage House! It would have suited
me in every respect. --Pursuing her way along the lane, she then began it. Bennet, have you no more lanes
hereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way again to-day?"

"I advise Mr. With the kindest concern he
     came on to Longbourn, and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner
     most creditable to his heart. "

"I am talking of possibilities, Charles. She now lost every expectation of pleasure. "

"Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside. They contained no actual complaint, nor was there any
revival of past occurrences, or any communication of present suffering. "

"I must think your language too strong in speaking of both," replied
Jane, "and I hope you will be convinced of it, by seeing them happy
together. ' Allow me, by the
way, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the notice and
kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the
advantages in my power to offer. The recollection of what I
then said, of my conduct, my manners, my expressions during the whole of
it, is now, and has been many months, inexpressibly painful to me. His behaviour to myself has been
scandalous; but I verily believe I could forgive him any thing and every
thing, rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory
of his father. "

Another intreaty that she would be serious, however, produced the
desired effect; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn assurances of
attachment. Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so--but still they admired
her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and one whom
they should not object to know more of. I depend on you for that. Elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the distress of
the moment, been led to make Mr. Darcy?"

"As much as I ever wish to be," cried Elizabeth warmly,--"I have spent
four days in the same house with him, and I think him very
disagreeable. Bennet," as she entered the room, "we have had a most
delightful evening, a most excellent ball. "

Her performance was pleasing, though by no means capital. Elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her
delight in the prospect of their relationship. "I have found out," said he, "by a singular accident, that there is now
in the room a near relation of my patroness. She had scarcely needed her
present observation to be satisfied, from the reason of things, that
their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love, rather
than by his; and she would have wondered why, without violently caring
for her, he chose to elope with her at all, had she not felt certain
that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; and
if that were the case, he was not the young man to resist an opportunity
of having a companion. What made you so shy of me, when you first
called, and afterwards dined here? Why, especially, when you called, did
you look as if you did not care about me?"

"Because you were grave and silent, and gave me no encouragement. "

Elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement, but was too much oppressed to
make any reply. Denny had
brought him from London, and that he was to have a lieutenant's
commission in the ----shire. He began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too much attention. Never mind Miss
Lizzy's hair. E. Your tempers are by no means unlike. She answered him with cold civility. Darcy they had
only seen at church. How you must have hated me after _that_ evening?"

"Hate you! I was angry perhaps at first, but my anger soon began to take
a proper direction. Collins,
was a most humiliating picture!--And to the pang of a friend disgracing
herself and sunk in her esteem, was added the distressing conviction
that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot
she had chosen. But as to your
other objection, I am afraid it will hardly hold good. But Jane and Elizabeth, who
agreed in wishing, for the sake of their sister's feelings and
consequence, that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents,
urged him so earnestly, yet so rationally and so mildly, to receive her
and her husband at Longbourn, as soon as they were married, that he was
prevailed on to think as they thought, and act as they wished. His revenge would have been complete indeed. "

She did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses
were engaged. When they repaired to the
dining-room, Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley would take
the place, which, in all their former parties, had belonged to him, by
her sister. org/stream/novelstextbasedo02austuoft#page/n23/mode/2up


Transcriber's note:

      Text enclosed by underscores is in italics (_italics_). I am
perfectly satisfied from what his manners now are, that he never had any
design of engaging my affection. "

"That is very true," said Elizabeth; "though it had not occurred to me
before. Collins's side, and as many bows on Sir William's, they departed. Bennet, "that is very unlucky. "

"An excellent consolation in its way," said Elizabeth, "but it will not
do for _us_. What a contrast did it offer to his last address in Rosing's Park, when
he put his letter into her hand! She knew not what to think, nor how to
account for it. She went on. If, as I conclude will be the case, you send me full powers to act
     in your name, throughout the whole of this business, I will
     immediately give directions to Haggerston for preparing a proper
     settlement. And pray, Lizzy, what said Lady Catherine
about this report? Did she call to refuse her consent?"

To this question his daughter replied only with a laugh; and as it had
been asked without the least suspicion, she was not distressed by his
repeating it. "My dear Madam," he replied, "this invitation is particularly
gratifying, because it is what I have been hoping to receive; and you
may be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon as
possible. Philips was always glad to see her nieces, and the two eldest, from
their recent absence, were particularly welcome, and she was eagerly
expressing her surprise at their sudden return home, which, as their own
carriage had not fetched them, she should have known nothing about, if
she had not happened to see Mr. I thought it my duty
to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin, that she and
her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about, and not run
hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned. Collins,
gratefully accepted, and immediately ordered. gutenberg. Darcy's using him ill, it is perfectly false; for, on the contrary, he
has been always remarkably kind to him, though George Wickham has
treated Mr. Mr. "I can comprehend your going on charmingly, when
you had once made a beginning; but what could set you off in the first
place?"

"I cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the words, which
laid the foundation. Hurst and Miss Bingley, and the lady with whom she lived in
London. The looks and behaviour of every body they had seen were
discussed, except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention. And to be kept back on _such_ a motive!--I think it
would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of
mind. It would have been strange if they had. "

"I should never have considered the distance as one of the _advantages_
of the match," cried Elizabeth. What
could be more natural than his asking you again? He could not help
seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in
the room. Mr. One cannot wonder that so
very fine a young man, with family, fortune, every thing in his favour,
should think highly of himself. "

"It is well. You blamed me for coming?"

"No indeed; I felt nothing but surprise. Bennet and
the children. Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily
attached to her situation, that she could, upon the whole, have no cause
to repine. Darcy was attending them to their
carriage, Miss Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on
Elizabeth's person, behaviour, and dress. The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters
and of his overpowering friend, assisted by the attractions of Miss
Darcy and the amusements of London, might be too much, she feared, for
the strength of his attachment. "

"Sir, you quite misunderstand me," said Mrs. He knows where we live. --I
am excessively attentive to all those things. "

"I never can be thankful, Mr. Did you see it?"

Bingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations. Elizabeth had mentioned her
name to her mother, on her ladyship's entrance, though no request of
introduction had been made. Let me recommend you, however, as a friend,
not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions; for as to Mr. But I am at his disposal.
